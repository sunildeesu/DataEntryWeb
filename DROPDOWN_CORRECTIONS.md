## ❌ REMOVED: Village Data Table (No Dropdowns)

All village data fields are now **plain text or number inputs**, matching Excel:

- **Date inputs** for date of flying
- **Textarea** for spot errors (multi-line)

## ✅ PRESERVED: Check Points Modal (ANEX-IV)

The check points modal retains dropdowns because **ANEX-IV sheet has data validation**:
- On Marker: Y/N dropdown (validated in Excel)
- Spatially Well Distributed: Y/N dropdown (validated in Excel)

## Excel Data Validation Analysis

From `check_formulas.py` output:

```
ENTRY Sheet Data Validation:
  Range: E2  → Examiner Name
  Range: E3  → Designation
  Range: H5  → District
  Range: H6  → Taluk
  Range: F7  → Agency

ANEX-IV Data Validation:
  Range: C8:C9, C13:C14, etc. → Y/N for check points
```

## Comparison: Before vs After

| Field | Before | After | Reason |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| Examiner Name | Text input with datalist | ✅ SELECT dropdown | Excel has validation |
| Designation | Text input | ✅ SELECT dropdown | Excel has validation |
