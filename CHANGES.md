- Cannot type custom values

### Datalist (Autocomplete with Custom Input)
- Provides suggestions as user types
- User can still enter custom values
- Used for: District, Taluk, Hobli, CORS stations, Agency names
- Flexible for new/different values

## Benefits

1. **Faster Data Entry**: Click to select instead of typing
2. **Data Consistency**: Standardized values (e.g., "YES" vs "Yes" vs "yes")
3. **Reduced Errors**: Less typing means fewer typos
4. **User Guidance**: Shows available/expected values
5. **Flexibility**: Datalists allow custom values when needed

## How to Use

### Select Dropdowns
1. Click on the field
2. Choose from the list
3. Cannot type custom values

### Datalist Fields
1. Click on field or start typing
2. Suggestions appear automatically
3. Click a suggestion or continue typing custom value
4. Press Enter or Tab to confirm

## Data Source

All dropdown values were extracted from the actual data in `QAQC-FS8-Acceptance.xlsx`:
- Analyzed existing entries (rows 10-12)
- Identified unique values per column
- Added common/expected values based on the data patterns

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Dynamic CORS station list from database
- District-Taluk dependency (auto-filter Taluks by District)
- Validation rules enforcement
- Import dropdown lists from external configuration file
